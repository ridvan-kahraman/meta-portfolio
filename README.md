# Meta Portfolio

> **Purpose**: This repository serves as a **professional portfolio summary**, documenting both my public roadmap work and contributions to private industrial projects.
> No source code is shared here. Instead, this repo clearly records what I’ve worked on, what I’ve achieved, which roadmaps I’ve followed, and what competencies I’ve acquired.

## 📌 Contents

### 🔹 1. Roadmaps
> Publicly available roadmap projects that I follow weekly on GitHub:

- [Industrial Fullstack Developer Roadmap (8 + 28 Months)](https://github.com/ridvan-kahraman/industrial-fullstack-roadmap)
- Covers areas like C#, .NET, CODESYS, IoT, SCADA, and Computer Vision with a structured monthly curriculum.

### 🔹 2. Daily Private Contribution Logs (`daily-log/`)
> My daily contributions to private company projects are summarized here. Source code is **not** shared, but logs indicate which modules were worked on and what types of commits were made.

Example Log:

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists
This repo makes my **invisible developer contributions visible**, providing a transparent way to document my progress and offer proof of competency to employers or collaborators.

The code may be private—but **growth, discipline, and vision remain visible.**

> “Effort is hidden, but its impact echoes. System building is more than code — it’s consistency, context, and contribution.”
