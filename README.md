# Meta Portfolio

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as a **professional meta-portfolio**, documenting my long-term technical development, public roadmap progress, and contributions to private industrial projects.  

It is designed to make **otherwise invisible engineering work visible**—without exposing proprietary code or violating NDAs.  

---

## 📌 Audience

- Future Employers
- Technical Mentors
- Engineers and Collaborators

This repository provides evidence of **discipline, consistency, and system-level thinking** rather than source code.  

> 🔒 **Important**  
> No proprietary source code is shared.  
> This repo transparently records what I’ve worked on, what I’ve achieved, what roadmaps I’ve followed, and which competencies I’ve built.

## 📌 Contents

### 🔹 1. Roadmaps

Publicly available roadmap projects I follow weekly on GitHub:  

- **Industrial Fullstack Developer Roadmap (12 Months)**  
Covers C#, .NET, CODESYS, IoT, SCADA, and Computer Vision with a structured monthly curriculum.  

Progress and learning artifacts are tracked in a separate public repository:  

🔗 [**Industrial Fullstack Developer Roadmap**](https://github.com/ridvan-kahraman/industrial-fullstack-roadmap)  

### 🔹 2. Daily Private Contribution Logs (`daily_log/`)

Summarized daily records of work performed on **private industrial projects**.  

> 🔒 **Important**  
> No Source code is published.  
> Logs describe **modules, architectural layers, and problem domains**.  
> Entries reflect real engineering activity while remaining NDA-compliant.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

In industrial and safety-critical environments, most meaningful work cannot be shared publicly.  

This repository exists to:  
- Make **engineering effort and progression visible**.
- Demonstrate **ownership, consistency, and architectural thinking**.
- Provide context for private contributions without leaking IP.

The code may be private, but **growth, structure, and intent are transparent**.  

> *Systems are not built only with code, but with consistency, context, and sustained effort.*  

---

## 🔒 Confidentiality Notice

- All descriptions are **high-level and anonymized**.
- No proprietary algorithms, internal architectures, or sensitive data are disclosed.
- Project names and identifiers are generalized where necessary.
- Fully compliant with company NDAs and security policies.
