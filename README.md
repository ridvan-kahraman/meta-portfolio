# Meta Portfolio

**Purpose:** This repository serves as a **professional portfolio summary**, documenting both my public roadmap progress and contributions to private industrial projects.  
**Note:** No source code is shared here. Instead, this repo transparently records what I’ve worked on, what I’ve achieved, which roadmaps I’ve followed, and what competencies I’ve built.

### 🔹 2. Daily Private Contribution Logs (`daily-log/`)
My daily contributions to private company projects are summarized here.  
**Source code is not shared**, but logs indicate which modules were worked on and what types of commits were made.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists
This repo makes my **invisible developer contributions** visible — offering clear proof of progress, discipline, and domain competence to collaborators, mentors, or employers.

The code may be private—but **growth, discipline, and vision remain visible.**

> “Effort is hidden, but its impact echoes.
System building is more than code — it’s consistency, context, and contribution.”
